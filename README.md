## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ SASS

## Reason for creation

To build a UI kit styled using SASS for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

The webpage is mobile-first responsive. Styled with SASS. Matches provided mockup.
 
## Backstory

This project is an exercise in SASS. At this point it was all new to me. Once I got all my individual SASS files setup I found them easy to navigate. It makes large-scale styling easier and cleaner to manage.
